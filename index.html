                        Vegetarian food often gets a bad reputation for being a boring nutrition lifestyle. 
                        However, with our hardworking crew, we are able to introduce a new outlook on vegetarian dishes. 
                        After many trials, we have deducted only the best most savory dishes for our valued customers. Countless nights
                        have been put into our menu. Although the menu may be small, note that our passion for making sure that
                        each dish is up to our high standards, is what comes first. At Vintage Vegan we value quality over quantity.
                        Not to mention how we believe that our small menu makes us unique to our small community.

            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p><b>Nothing short of your typical vegetarian restaurant, we serve your typical healthy greens. However, what sets our restaurant apart 
            from others is the fact that we add a bit of our culture and a twist to every dish. Typical restaurants follow a common theme
            and set a certain tone for what you are in for. Our restaurant, on the other hand, surprises its customers with a featured menu. 
            This featured menu highlights our most popular dishes which are known and noted for their uniqueness in style. The typical 
            salad is now taken a step further into the workshop, our kitchen, and is ensured to have a factor that sets it apart from your
            typical salad. Each dish includes a description of what ingredients to expect from the dish.
            Support from our customers is very important to the well-being of our restaurant. Each dish bought is another try at a loyal 
            customer. We thank those who continue to come back and support us by ordering more of their favorite dishes.</b></p>
