                It all started when four friends decided to work together and open up a restaurant of their dreams. After all the difficult times and triumphs, 
                they were able to finally open what they had worked so hard to create, Vintage Vegan. Even though many did not believe their restaurant would succeed,
                these four friends stayed true to their hearts and pushed through all of the negative thoughts. After all, they were able to open and yield positive feedback 
                from their opening night. After years of working together, they have been able to give our guests 5 years of savory dishes, and 
                ultimately decided to create a welcoming environment for their customers. We keep in mind our customers when constructing new dishes. We truly do appreciate 
                those who have supported our restaurant in our highs and lows. Special thanks to those who continue to visit us regularly and allow us to replenish their 
                palette with our delicious dishes.

	            Sincerely, 
	            Vintage Vegan.
